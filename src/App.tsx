//  4. Discussion- Building Reusable Components


// problem is component is less reusable because they rely on store existence to   function

//  in constast  passsing props makes our comopnet more self contains and resuable 
// because they don't rely on esternal data source
//  in our case it's highly unlikely we are going to reuse component with differnt kind of data sets

// example genreList always want to know selectedGenre in store

// if situration changes we can always modify these components and pass data through  props 

//  there is no-one-size-fit rule for managing state in react

//  so we should first look for specific need of our project and chose approach fits 
// those needs
